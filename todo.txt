	# command: get books by author
	# option: "--filter=abc" to get books like '%abc%'
	
Framework and tech debt
	# build extensible CLI framework
	
		commands.json maps command names to command class names. Command classes must
		implement command interface and provide execute method, which CLI framework calls.
		
		Each command calls to service layer, and service layer interacts with the ORM.
	# Collections do filtered queries:
		given attribute, comparison type (less than, equal to, and greater than), and comparisonValue
		
		(also possible with activeRecord model, coupled to DB, if expose setId publicly or 
		as package private).
	
	# implement options
	# everything tested
