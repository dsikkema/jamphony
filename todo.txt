	# figure out how to merge/override/combine guice configuration modules
		figure out how to override modules with guice... have one module provided by the 
		CLI library, and another one by default package which can override.
  
		e.g. CLI fw provides a module that maps its interfaces etc but the default package
		can add extra mapping to the module and override things
		
	# allow some kind of merging/combining command modules
		
		right now it allows allows one: you configure guice to map the command module 
		interface to *your* command module implementation
