Framework and tech debt
	# build extensible CLI framework
	
		commands.json maps command names to command class names. Command classes must
		implement command interface and provide execute method, which CLI framework calls.
		
		Each command calls to service layer, and service layer interacts with the ORM.
	# Collections do filtered queries:
		given attribute, comparison type (less than, equal to, and greater than), and comparisonValue
		
		(also possible with activeRecord model, coupled to DB, if expose setId publicly or 
		as package private).
	
	# Use builders, repositories, and collections?
	
		Client only uses repository, collection. Client cannot change entity ID.
		
		ID is set in constructor only: if you provide ID in constructor, you must also
		provide every other value so that object is immediately saveable. Constructor only
		called by builder, builder only called by repository and collection.
		
		Entity has two constructors: empty and with all attributes included.
